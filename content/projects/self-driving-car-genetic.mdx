##  The Road to Autonomous Driving

What if a self-driving car could **teach itself to drive**, just like evolution shapes life? Instead of training with labeled data, this project **evolves** driving skills using **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**.

Through **natural selection**, our cars learn to **avoid obstacles, optimize speed, and navigate efficiently**—all without explicit programming.

##  The Evolution of an AI Driver

Traditional reinforcement learning often requires **reward functions**, but our **genetic algorithm-based AI** finds optimal driving behaviors **without predefined rewards**. Instead, we use **evolutionary selection, crossover, and mutation** to improve driving strategies.

Key Features:
-  **Genetic Algorithm-based Learning**: No explicit rules—only evolution.
-  **Real-time Driving Simulation**: Watch cars learn and improve dynamically.
-  **Elitism & Crossover Techniques**: Ensuring top-performing drivers evolve.

##  **How It Works**

The system starts with **randomly initialized driving strategies**. Over multiple generations, the genetic algorithm **selects the best-performing cars**, allowing them to pass their "genes" (weights of the neural network) to the next generation.

###  **Step 1: Creating the Population**
Each car in the simulation has its own **neural network controller**, initialized with **random weights**.

```javascript
class Car {
    constructor() {
        this.brain = new NeuralNetwork([5, 8, 4]); // Sensor inputs → Hidden layer → Controls
    }
}
```

---

###  **Step 2: Evolution through Natural Selection**
The best drivers are chosen based on **distance traveled** and **collision avoidance**.

```javascript
function selectBestCars(cars) {
    return cars.sort((a, b) => b.fitness - a.fitness).slice(0, topPerformers);
}
```

**Top drivers are selected, then "breeding" (crossover) occurs**.

```javascript
function crossover(parent1, parent2) {
    let child = new Car();
    child.brain.weights = mixWeights(parent1.brain.weights, parent2.brain.weights);
    return child;
}
```

---

###  **Step 3: Mutation for Exploration**
To avoid premature convergence, we introduce **random mutations** in the neural network.

```javascript
function mutate(car) {
    for (let i = 0; i < car.brain.weights.length; i++) {
        if (Math.random() < mutationRate) {
            car.brain.weights[i] += (Math.random() - 0.5) * mutationStrength;
        }
    }
}
```
