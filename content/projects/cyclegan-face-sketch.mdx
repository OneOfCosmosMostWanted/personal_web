##  The Art of Transformation

Imagine being able to **breathe life into a simple sketch**, transforming rough pencil lines into a **vivid, realistic portrait**. 

Artists, forensic investigators, and digital creators all share a **common challenge**—bridging the gap between **sketched concepts and photorealistic renderings**. With **CycleGAN and a custom UNet-based architecture**, we bring AI-powered transformation to **face sketch conversion**.

##  The Science Behind the Art

Traditional **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** often struggle with **cycle consistency** when learning mappings between two domains. **CycleGAN**, however, enables **bidirectional mapping** between **face sketches and realistic portraits** without needing perfectly paired training images.

To enhance performance, we implemented:
-  **Custom-Modified UNet**: Improving encoder-decoder pathways for sharper details.
-  **Local Self-Attention**: Enhancing texture details in fine regions like eyes & hair.
-  **Buffered Past Images**: Reducing mode collapse and improving training stability.

##  **How It Works**

At its core, **CycleGAN** consists of two generators and two discriminators:
- **Generator A → B**: Converts sketches to portraits.
- **Generator B → A**: Converts portraits back to sketches.
- **Cycle Consistency Loss**: Ensures that a converted portrait can be reconstructed back into its original sketch.

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
We prepare **unpaired** datasets containing **sketches and real faces**.

```python
from dataset_loader import load_data

# Load sketches and portrait datasets
sketches, portraits = load_data("data/sketches", "data/portraits")

# Visualize samples
show_images(sketches[:5], title="Sample Sketches")
show_images(portraits[:5], title="Sample Portraits")
```

---

###  **Step 2: Training the CycleGAN**
Our **custom UNet architecture** enhances the generator’s performance.

```python
from cyclegan import CycleGAN

# Initialize CycleGAN model with custom UNet
model = CycleGAN(input_shape=(256, 256, 3), use_custom_unet=True)

# Train model
model.train(sketches, portraits, epochs=100, batch_size=16)
```

By incorporating **local self-attention layers**, our generator learns to focus on **critical face regions**, improving **texture quality and fine-grained details**.

---

### **Step 3: Generating Realistic Portraits**
After training, we **convert a new sketch into a realistic face**.

```python
from cyclegan import generate_image

# Load trained model
model.load_weights("cyclegan_weights.h5")

# Convert sketch to portrait
portrait = generate_image(model, input_sketch="test_sketch.png")

# Show result
display_image(portrait, title="Generated Portrait")
```

The result? A **lifelike face**, retaining the unique structure of the original sketch.
