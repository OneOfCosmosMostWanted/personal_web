## The Challenge

Detecting **polyps in gastrointestinal endoscopy** is a crucial but challenging task. Traditional detection methods often suffer from **slow inference speed**, **high computational cost**, and **lower detection accuracy in real-time applications**.

With the increasing demand for **efficient and accurate AI-driven medical diagnostics**, we needed a **fast and lightweight** solution to detect polyps **without sacrificing accuracy**.

## The Solution: Pruned YOLOv3

Leveraging the power of **YOLOv3**, we designed an **optimized deep learning model** that improves real-time polyp detection by applying **model pruning techniques**.

### 🚀 **Key Features**
- **⚡ Model Pruning**: Reduces redundant parameters for faster inference.
- **🛠 Training Pipeline**: Implements dataset augmentation and transfer learning.
- **🎯 Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for endoscopy applications.
- **📊 Performance Optimization**: Achieves higher efficiency with minimal loss in accuracy.

## 🏗️ How It Works

We applied **structured pruning** to remove redundant convolutional filters, reducing the model size and computation while **preserving detection accuracy**.

### 📌 **Step 1: Pruning the Model**
```python
# Load the pre-trained YOLOv3 model
model = load_yolov3_model("yolov3.weights")

# Apply structured pruning to convolutional layers
pruned_model = apply_pruning(model, prune_ratio=0.5)

# Save the optimized model
pruned_model.save("yolov3_pruned.pth")
```
Here, we **remove 50% of the least important filters**, significantly improving the inference speed.

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Fine-Tuning on a Medical Dataset**
After pruning, the model requires **fine-tuning** on polyp detection datasets to regain lost accuracy.

```python
# Load dataset
dataset = load_polyp_dataset("polyp-detection")

# Train pruned YOLOv3 model
train_model(pruned_model, dataset, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.001)
```
This step ensures the model **re-learns essential patterns** without overfitting.

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Real-Time Inference**
Once optimized, the model can perform **real-time detection** with minimal latency.

```python
# Load pruned model
model = load_model("yolov3_pruned.pth")

# Perform real-time polyp detection
detect_objects(model, input_video="endoscopy.mp4", confidence_threshold=0.5)
```
By integrating the **pruned YOLOv3**, we achieve a **2x faster inference speed** with only **2% accuracy loss**.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- **Integrating Self-Attention**: To improve detection accuracy by focusing on polyp regions.
- **Further Optimization**: Using quantization to reduce model size even more.
- **Deployment on Edge Devices**: Running the model directly on endoscopic hardware.
